### About

These featured audio waveform visualizers are made for the upcoming Audio Production modules, to assist in demonstrating the implementation of certain effects through both audio and visual representation. Please try them out, and if you encounter any issues, please [report it](/contact?t=Report_Issue&l=a&id=0). Include steps to reproduce the bug, browser name, browser version, and your operating system if possible.

### Audio Comparison Visualizer

Uses two audio files (192kbps, 44.1kHz, 16-bit), each representing:

- the "before" state of applying an effect.
- the "after" state of applying an effect.

Initiated with the FX turned off, users can:

- switch between the before and after of applying an effect by toggling the "FX" button.
- play, pause, and adjust the volume of the audio.
- seek audio playback position by clicking on the waveform.
