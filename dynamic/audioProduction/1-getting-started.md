### Can I trust this method?

No, you shouldn’t take everything written here word for word. I am not an audio engineer, and everything in this Audio Production library is based off my own knowledge and experiences. While I'm sure these tutorials would help you if you are a beginner, I am not confident it can help someone already very experienced in audio production. A lot of the audio production modules shown here have information tailored to working with fingerstyle recordings, so those already experienced in audio production might be able to find some new knowledge there. If there is anything here that is different from how you were taught, please submit a correction request at \_\_ or discuss it in Fingerstyle Central. Always question why certain things work out the way they do in this process instead of taking what’s said as an absolute truth.
