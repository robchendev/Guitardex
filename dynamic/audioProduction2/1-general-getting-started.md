### Aim of this library

This library is created as a comprehensive guide to audio production for fingersyle.

- Talk about not audio engr
- ...

I am not a trained audio engineer, nor do I have any certificates in this field. This audio production library is put together with a combination of my own side research, experience, and peer review with others who have experience within this field.

At the time of writing this, there are not many comprehensive guides on the audio production process for fingerstyle guitar music. At one end of the spectrum for currently existing guides are many short guides that musicians put up to showcase their process in mixing without explaining their thought processes, causing confusion and [common beginner mistakes](2). The other end of the spectrum are the extremely long guides that teaches you more than you want to know.

.... This library aims to be a compromise between the short and long guides. I understand not everyone wants to spend time to learn everything about audio production especially if they do not know where to start.

If you are experienced with audio production already and are confident with your own audio, these audio production guides may not help you. You can still browse them to see if there's anything new you can learn.

### Recommended approach

Unlike the Techniques library, this library's modules are listed in a specific order.

You can approach this library in several ways. Depending on your previous experience, you may not need to go over everything in order.

There are 5 categories in this library: **General**, **Recording**, **Mixing**, **Mastering**, **Concepts**. To get started, you should read over every module in the General category, then proceed to the Recording, Mixing, or Mastering categories. If you're an absolute beginner, I recommend reading in the order of Recording -> Mixing -> Mastering.

The **Concept** modules aren't listed in any specific order. They will be linked and referred to in relevant modules if the knowledge is needed to help explain something.

[[[TODO: Have a list of links]]]

- Beginner; I want to learn everything (link)
- Beginner; I just want to know the bare minimum (link)
- Intermediate; I already know the basics, I want to learn how to do it specifically for fingerstyle. (link)

### Addition of new modules

A module is a page for a single topic. For example, this page "Getting Started" itself is a module. Each module will be isolated as much as possible from others to allow for easier referencing in random order. Modules that have pre-requisites are written in a way that assumes you've understood the pre-required modules.

Some of the listed modules are inaccessible. In total, there are currently 64 planned modules. Making these modules will each take time to make the information presented as accurate as my ability allows, through careful fact checking and peer reviews. Because of this, the initial release of this library will include only a few available modules and the others will be released once they are ready.
