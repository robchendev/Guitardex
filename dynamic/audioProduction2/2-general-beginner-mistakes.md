### Mistake: Copying other's settings

A common beginner mistake is copying settings from a video tutorial instead of spending time to understand what each adjustment to the audio does and figure out what is good.

Settings that work for one person may not work well for the next. There are several reasons:

- Your preferences are different from the person whose settings you're copying
- Your guitars are different
- Your recording environment are different (room [acoustics](33), mic positioning)
- Your playing styles and tonal qualities are different
- Your recording configurations are different (mic positions)

Furthermore, a lack of understanding can lead to these unexpected outcomes. For example:

- Graphs of different plugins scale differently. The [EQ](16) graph of one person's tutorial might be different than yours, and copying the graph's adjustments visually can cause unintended effect. Someone's adjustment of 2dB gain at 8kHz to slightly brighten their mix could look the same as 10dB gain at 10kHz on your screen. Due to this, instead of slightly brightening your mix, you just made your mix painfully harsh to your listeners.
-

If you have an understanding of what each adjustment to your audio does, you can make less mistakes like these.

On first impressions, you may think that the copied settings sound good enough for your project, but there are a lot more you can do to it yourself to make it better.

### Mistake: Listening on high volume

When listening on high volume, you build up [ear fatigue](102) quickly, which will cause your mix to sound worse and worse to you. Bad sounds are harder to identify and good sounds don't sound as good. Everything starts sounding like it is being played through a speaker underwater, and your eardrums become increasingly uncomfortable.

Not only is this inconvenient, it's also dangerous as your ears become less sensitive to increases in volume and you eventually reach a dangerous volume level that can cause permanent damage. Once your mix starts sounding as mentioned above, stop and take at least a 15 minute break. ...

Remember the bulk of your listening audience will not be listening on such a high volume. Your goal should be to mix your audio so that it sounds good at an average listening level. If you can get your audio to sound good when being played quietly, it will sound good when being played loudly.

### Mistake: Randomly changing settings

Be careful with the mindset of "If I just add this plugin in here and mess with the dials at random it'll sound somewhat better than what I had before".

It's a good idea to experiment to build upon your understanding of what the plugin does and gain some experience using the effect. But simply adding a plugin into the processing chain can have negative effects just as much as it has positive effects if you adjust the settings without understanding what they do.

### Mistake: Not changing any settings

If you just add the effect from your plugin library into your processing chain, chances are that effect will do nothing. Some effects wouldn't change anything in your audio based if a single setting hasn't been changed, such as Mix %, decay, threshold, ratio, etc.

### Mistake: Trying too many things at once

A good reason for using a [DAW](22) is to have the ability to go back to previous edits and change your settings whenever you want.

It's okay to put all your plugins into your current processing chain as a template so you don't have to order them later, as long as they're off while you work on adjusting the parameters of each previous plugin.
