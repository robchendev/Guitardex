### What you'll need

Certain DAWs provide multiple versions, some free, some costing more than others. In our case, every DAW will be able to do the same thing, and you will only need the least expensive version for what we'll be doing here.

CHANGE THIS SENTENCE ITS BAD

#### Logic Pro

#### Cubase

- Really good recording interface

#### Ableton

- Has free version?

#### FL Studio

- Great for sampling and piano roll...
- A little too overly complicated for recording purposes

#### Audacity

- Good for general audio editing
- Does not have capabilities that a DAW usually has: routing, ability to change previous effects without undoing the whole chain linearly.
- Not recommended for this curriculum

#### Others

... Include linux-compatible DAWs as well
