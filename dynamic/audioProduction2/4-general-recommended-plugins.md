### Cost of plugins

Plugins generally will cost money, but I will try providing free alternatives.

Depending on the DAW you use, you could already have pre-installed plugins as part of the default options for that DAW. Most of these plugins are really good, and you wouldn't need to change to another unless you want a certain sound or control that another plugin offers.

### Disclaimer

I am not affiliated with any of the companies that sell these plugins.

#### Plugin Bundles

- iZotope Ozone

### The Plugins This Curriculum Will Use

This curriculum will demonstrate post-processing methods using these plugins, but keep in mind you do not need these plugins to start learning and using information that this curriculum teaches. Your sound may be very slightly different, but the information you learn will be applicable to any plugin of the same effect. (i.e. if you learn how to use compression with Fabfilter Pro Q, you can apply the same knowledge and experience to iZotope Ozone Dynamics. Both are compression plugins with different user interfaces.)
