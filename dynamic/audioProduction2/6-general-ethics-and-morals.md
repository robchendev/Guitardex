### Crossfading

- Industry norm, called "Comping" when done en masse.

### Multitracking

- When used for clarity for audience enjoyment, good.
- When used to construct solo guitar audio for your ease, it's questionable.

### Using synthetic guitar playing in your audio

- Don't do this.
- Literally faking your playing skills.
