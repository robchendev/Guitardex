### Crossfading

- Industry norm, called "Comping" when done en masse.
- How to do it: Record separate takes for the same track and combine the best parts of each together.
- Pros:
  - Can save time when you got very few minor mistakes in a long song.
- Cons:
  - Can cause tempo inconsistency in the audio
  - Can cause the audio's characteristics to warp, eg. two recordings recorded at different sitting positions can affect how loud each individual mic is.
  - Will be noticed by more seasoned guitarists if used excessively.
  - Makes you complacent in less-than-ideal proficiency at a song.
- No one can stop you, and hardly anyone would be able to tell well-comped song from a properly recorded perfect take. How much you choose to rely on this tool to record is up to you. As a musician, you should aim to use it to make recording slightly easier. If you rely on it too much, your true skills will be misrepresented and someone would eventually find out.

### Multitracking

- When used for clarity for audience enjoyment, good.
- When used to construct solo guitar audio for your ease, it's questionable.

### Using synthetic guitar playing in your audio

- Don't do this.
- Literally faking your playing skills.
