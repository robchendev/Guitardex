### Crossfading

- Industry norm, called "Comping" when done en masse.
- How to do it: Record separate takes for the same track and combine the best parts of each together.
- Pros:
  - Can save time when you got very few minor mistakes in a long song.
- Cons:
  - Can cause tempo inconsistency in the audio
  - Can cause the audio's characteristics to warp, eg. two recordings recorded at different sitting positions can affect how loud each individual mic is.
  - Will be noticed by more seasoned guitarists if used excessively.
  - Makes you complacent in less-than-ideal proficiency at a song.
- No one can stop you, and hardly anyone would be able to tell well-comped song from a properly recorded perfect take. How much you choose to rely on this tool to record is up to you. As a musician, you should aim to use it to make recording slightly easier. If you rely on it too much, your true skills will be misrepresented and someone would eventually find out.

### Multitracking

- When used for clarity for audience enjoyment, good.
- When used to construct solo guitar audio for your ease, it's questionable.

### Using synthetic guitar playing in your audio

- Don't do this.
- Literally faking your playing skills.

#### Examples of guitarists faking audio

There is a rise of guitarists faking their audio these days. And I'm not just talking about multitracking for clarity, or comping for achieving the perfect take. I'm talking about inserting notes via VSTs such as Ample Guitar and pretending to play them.

Most viewers accept these kinds of faked performances without question and instead become discouraged because they cannot produce the same sound with a replication of the technique.

When you accumulate a decent amount of playing ability
or experience in audio production, you will become more accurate at telling if a performance is authentic or not.

Here are a few links. Guess which one has heavily faked audio:

A: ["Unravel" by Gordon Cang](https://youtu.be/ECzxrM6WPO4)

B: ["Spain-Chick Corea" by Jaco Liu](https://youtu.be/HKCDz4l-Q2s)

If you don't get these right, don't worry. As you gain more experience hands-on with mixing and mastering your audio tracks, you will gain a feel for what is possible and what isn't.

Unfortunately, given the nature of faking guitar performances with VSTs, individuals that lack experience in guitar playing or audio production find it challenging to discern these deceptions. This ignorance leads to unrealistic expectations and discouragement among guitarists who cannot replicate the sounds they hear in the performances even if they replicate the exact motion of the performer's hands.

The easiest way to prove that a performance hasn't been faked is to play it live, in person. However this isn't a good way to prove since the burden of proof should be on the accuser. So let's put it this way:

In the above examples, A (Gordon Cang) and B (Jaco Liu), if someone didn't know better, they'd think that Gordon Cang is a better player. However, Gordon Cang has not played his songs in a live performance before. Meanwhile, Jaco Liu played live so many times that he'd been banned from Fingerstyle China competitions for winning too many times.

#### Why this is bad

Not only does this impose a false expectation to those
