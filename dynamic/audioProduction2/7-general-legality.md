### Covers are Derivative Works

Contrary to popular belief, if a musician `covers | makes a rendition of` a song, the musician does not hold rights to that cover. Instead, the cover falls under "derivative work",

...which makes the rightsholders of the original song own the cover.
...which makes it require permission and/or a mechanical license from the rightsholders of the original song to distribute online.

While this law may vary based on the original song's origin and licensing country, it is often protected under international law.

### Cover Song Licensing

Obtaining mechanical licenses for songs to distribute covers of it, as a hobbyist or even professional cover musician, is a tedious and costly process.

### YouTube

The reason why covers are so common on YouTube and are allowed is because YouTube operates under the Safe Harbor policy(?). This policy allows YouTube to host such content on their service as long as (FACTCHECK?)YouTube complies to takedown or claim requests quickly.(FACTCHECK?). Musicians that have popular covers on YouTube may find their videos claimed, or "revenue shared", which is similar to demonetization. The amount of revenue being taken away is commonly a very significant portion of the video's overall revenue.

This revenue sharing / content claiming is sometimes automatic and sometimes manual. YouTube's content ID system allows for automatic claiming based on various ways of identifying the content via song title, artist, lyrics, or even audio likeliness.

It is important that if you do end up receiving a claim from the rightsholder of a song for a cover that you made of that song, do not attempt to dispute it. They are within every right to claim your song unless you have obtained permission or a mechanical license for that cover. Initiating a dispute against the claim is an initiation of a legal proceeding, which could at worst land you in court.

Some musicians are able to connect with a MCN and get them to negotiate a deal with the rightsholders for better share in favor of the musician, but know that this may not be a viable option to take unless the MCN you're working with thinks going through the trouble of negotiating for you will be beneficial for them as well. Choosing the wrong one could lock you into a very unfavorable contract. ... You should do more research on MCNs before deciding to work with one.

### Music Streaming Services

Covers distributed onto other streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube Music (usually uploaded as "Artist Name - Topic") are licensed through a distributor such as Soundrop, Distrokid, and (any more?). These distributors have partnerships with licensing agencies and makes sure the licenses for each cover are handled legally,
