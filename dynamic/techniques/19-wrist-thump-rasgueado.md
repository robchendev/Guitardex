Like a rasgueado, the wrist thump rasgueado is commonly notated as 3 downward strums that are rhythmically close to each other and ridiculous to play using only downward strums. An O for the wrist thump is also included above the final strum by the index finger.

### Explanation

Combining the wrist thump and rasgueado techniques, you can put more emphasis on a `downbeat | the first beat of a measure`.

In the wrist thump rasgueado, you do the ring and middle fingers strums of the rasgueado as you normally would, transitioning into a wrist thump strum with your index finger on the downbeat.
