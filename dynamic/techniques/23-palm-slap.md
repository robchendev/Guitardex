The palm slap is commonly notated as either multiple Xs covering the majority of the strings in a tab, or one giant X cover all the strings.

### Explanation

The palm slap is a percussive slap that also `mutes | stop the strings from ringing` every string it comes in contact with. The slap sound comes from the guitar string coming in contact with the `fret wire | the metal strips on your fretboard` itself.

To do the palm slap, straighten your right index, middle, and ring fingers and put them together as if you were offering to give someone a handshake. Then slap these fingers down onto the strings.

Like any percussion technique, make sure to not put too much strength into the slap.

#### Palm slap follow-up

The palm slap commonly comes before an upwards [strum](16).
