The natural harmonic is notated in chevron brackets <>, sometimes with N.H. written above it. If the N.H. extends to multiple notes in a row with a dashed line, all those notes are natural harmonics.

### Explanation

A natural harmonic is played by gently touching (not pressing down on) the string directly above the `fret wire | the metal strips on your fretboard`. Using your left hand, touch the string directly above the fret wire and pick with your right hand.

This technique is used to get chime-like `tone | the note's sound depending on your guitar and how you play`, to substitute for a regular picked note, and to keep a note ringing without holding the string down.

#### Common Harmonic Frets

Theoretically, there is a harmonic at the `integer divisors | fractions where the denominator is a whole number (1, 2, 3...)` of the string length. When playing guitar, you will commonly see up to 1/4, and sometimes see 1/5 and 1/6. Smaller divisors are very rarely used. The parentheses () show the `intervals | distance in pitch between two notes` of the harmonic note when compared to the open string.

- 1/2 = <12> (Octave)
- 1/3 = <7> <19> (Octave + 5th)
- 1/4 = <5> <24> (2 Octaves)
- 1/5 = <4> <9> <16> <28> (2 Octaves + 3rd)
- 1/6 = <3.2> <30> (2 Octaves + 5th)

The smaller string divisor you play a harmonic on, the less audible it will be.

#### Getting a clean sound

Taking the finger off the string the moment you pick it can improve note clarity.

While getting a clean harmonic sound should not be an issue when picking in your usual position, picking near the `bridge | the wooden piece at the end of the strings next to where you pick` will improve the clarity.

### FAQ

#### Why is my harmonic not directly above the fret wire?

If you're trying to play, for example, a <12> harmonic but it is most clear when played somewhere to the left or right of the 12th `fret wire | the metal strips on your fretboard`, then your `intonation | the pitch accuracy of your fretboard` is not set up correctly. A bad intonation means that your guitar's fretted notes don't actually produce the note as accurately as they should, and the notes become more out of tune the higher you fret.
