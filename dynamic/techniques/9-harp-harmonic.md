Harp harmonics are notated as an alternation between artificial harmonics and normally picked notes to produce notes like a harp would.

### Explanation

The concept behind harp harmonics are easy to understand, but getting to the level of doing it consistently without accidentally `muting | stopping the strings from ringing` other strings can take time.

Harp harmonics refers to the alteranation between picking an artificial harmonic and picking normally picked notes.

The artificial harmonic is to be played by the thumb instead of the ring finger 12 frets above each string that is held down in a chord shape. This frees up your ring finger to be used on playing the normally picked notes.
